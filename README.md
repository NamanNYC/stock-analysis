#Module 2 Challenge: Refactored VBA Code By Naman Puri

##Overview of Project: 
The purpose of the Refactored VBA Code is an extension of the work we have done in Module 2. It is to show Steve, our newest client, how the different stocks that he was looking at performed in 2018 relative to 2017. He wanted to do this to help his parents properly invest in a well-performing stock. To accomplish this, we used the start code in order to help understand the ask of the project and clean up the code after we were finished. 

##Results: 
The result was that the code ran faster, but only marginally. This would be a lot more evident and helpful if there was a lot more data needed to be analyzed. Nonetheless, the refactored code serves its purpose for being more efficient than the original code. 

##Summary: 
The advantages of refactoring code is that it runs faster, it looks cleaner and it overall serves the purpose of efficiency. The disadvantages are that as the programmer, you have to think creatively how to simplify code that already works without breaking it in any way, and it takes up more time in the short term.
